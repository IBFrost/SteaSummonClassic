# SteaSummon
WoW Classic addon for warlock raid summoning

## One button summoning, shared summoning list...

Click one button to summon the next raider on the priority based list. Just keep clicking, nothing to read, nothing else to do. If you want to summon further down the list, you can do that too.

Features a minimal interface that gets out of your way while providing simple, easy, summoning for your whole raid. Warlocks who have the addon share the same summon list with status updates to drive the one button summoning. Other raiders also have the benefit of seeing their place on the summon list while helping to keep the list alive.

## Self management
When your raiders type a summon phrase e.g. 123, they get added to the global summoning list shared by everyone in your raid using the addon.

When they type -123, they remove themselves.
 

## Configuration

* summon trigger phrases
* summon communications through raid, whisper, and say
* summon list priorities (warlock, world buffs, named players)
* window scaling
* summon list save time (for relogging)
